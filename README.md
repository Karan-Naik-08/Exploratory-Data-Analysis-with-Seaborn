# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project is a guided Coursera project focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. The goal of this analysis is to explore and understand the patterns in the data related to tumor diagnosis, and to lay the groundwork for future predictive modeling.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Diagnostic data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Dataset Description:
- The dataset contains features that were computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.
- These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
- The data is used to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on these features.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project include:

- Performing data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploring the relationships between different features in the dataset.
- Visualizing the distribution of key features.
- Identifying trends and potential patterns for tumor diagnosis.

## Key Steps
- Data Loading and Cleaning:
Loaded the dataset from UCI.
Checked for missing or duplicate values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Explored the distribution of features like mean radius, mean texture, and more.
Visualized relationships between the target variable (diagnosis) and various features.
- Feature Correlation: Performed correlation analysis to identify which features are most strongly related to the diagnosis.
- Visualizations: Created various plots such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to analyze the data.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.

## Conclusion
The project provides an in-depth understanding of the Breast Cancer dataset and establishes a foundation for building predictive models that can classify tumors as benign or malignant.
